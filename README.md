# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and more. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed to develop a regression model capable of estimating property values with high accuracy.

## 📊 Project Objective

Build a predictive model that can estimate housing prices using historical data. The goal is to apply proper data cleaning, feature selection, and model tuning to achieve reliable and interpretable results.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Initial inspection of missing values, data types, and summary statistics.
   * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values and outliers.
   * Feature engineering (e.g., log transformations, scaling).
   * Encoding categorical variables.

3. **Modeling**

   * Tested multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   * Applied cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
   * Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score.

4. **Results**

   * Final model selected based on best performance and generalization.
   * Achieved competitive accuracy and a good balance between bias and variance.
